## Summary of Accomplishments

Today's central focus was dramatically improving the logical flow, progression control, and user experience of the AI Interviewer platform.

### 1. Robust Timer & Auto-Termination
- Fixed the passive timeout bug where candidates not speaking could bypass the 15-minute timer.
- Implemented `streamlit-autorefresh` (polling every 1s) decoupled from the speech logic to ensure the stream forcefully halts at exactly 15:00 and instantly projects the final score screen.

### 2. The "Crucible" Question Strategy
- Redefined the high-level prompt strategy to focus on information density, failure analysis, and trade-offs.
- **Strict 2-Question Rule:** Enforced a strict limitation of 2 questions per topic (Q1: Overview, Q2: Deep Dive).
- **Four-Phase Topic Progression:** 1) Project Role, 2) First Resume Claim, 3) Second Resume Claim, 4) Culture & Ethics.

### 3. State-Driven Dynamic Prompts (Anti-Repetition Engine)
- Solved the LLM "recency bias" issue where the model would get stuck looping on the same topics.
- Built a state machine in Python (`self.question_count` in `brain.py`) that forcefully injects strictly ordered topic instructions just prior to the user's turn to prevent topic repetition.

### 4. Dynamic Feedback Reactions
- Added conditional prompt logic telling the AI to briefly praise high-quality answers.
- Instructed AI to provide neutral, non-judgmental acknowledgment for poor/vague answers.
- Automatically bypasses topics instantly if the candidate explicitly states "I don't know."

### 5. Instruction & Disclaimer Gateway Page
- Developed an attractive intercept screen using Streamlit info boxes that appears before profile creation.
- Clearly states the format rules and highlights the specific behaviors that lead to termination (Zero Score).
- Displays the Crucible Evaluation metrics visibly to the user before they begin.

### 6. Multilingual Speech Ingestion (Deepgram)
- Configured Deepgram API (`listener.py`) to use the `nova-3-general` model with `detect_language=true`.
- Allows candidates to reply in any supported language (e.g., Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin). The audio is accurately captured, transcribed, and the LLM processes it while continuously replying only in professional English.
